## A Personal Note (Dedication)

I first played Traveller in 1982, using the Little Black Books in my friend's basement. We spent countless hours plotting jump routes, designing starships, and rolling 2D6 to see if we'd survive the next firefight.

Traveller taught me:
- That dice rolls have consequences
- That space is dangerous and beautiful
- That a good crew matters more than a good ship
- That the best stories come from player choices, not railroads

Four decades later, Traveller remains the finest science fiction RPG ever created. Marc Miller's vision, refined and expanded by Mongoose Publishing, continues to inspire new generations of players.

This project is my small attempt to give back to the game that shaped my love of science fiction, game design, and collaborative storytelling.

**Thank you, Marc Miller.**
**Thank you, Mongoose Publishing.**
**Thank you, to every referee and player who kept Traveller alive for 45+ years.**

*Per ardua ad astra* - Through adversity to the stars.

— Bruce, Longtime Traveller Enthusiast
   Player since 1982, Referee since 1985
